# Iterative-Prototype-3

#From the previous playtesting session

In last week's playtesting session, I realized the errors in my world building. 
The setting isn't important to the player when presented with the car and the ability to drive. 
Testers appreciated the resetting functionality because they had to make constant use of it. 
The players would consistently get stuck on the ridges left by the road generation. 
Testers indicated that the car needs improvements to its driving controls. 
The players said that they would like a test track but that when they were dropped into the game, they didn't know what was what. 
I should label the different events/places in the game. 
I also want to scale the game a bit better, trees were the wrong size and the terrain is bland.

# Design Hypothesis

I'm at the point now where I'm happy with the game and I just want to have more input on general gamefeel.
I have two questions: 

With a cleaner implementation, will the players finally be able to experience the gameplay I've designed for them?
Where will new issues arise and are they bugs or gameplay design opportunities?
