# Iterative-Prototype-3


#From the previous playtesting session

In last week's playtesting session, I realized the errors in my world building. 
The setting isn't important to the player when presented with the car and the ability to drive. 
Testers appreciated the resetting functionality because they had to make constant use of it. 
The players would consistently get stuck on the ridges left by the road generation. 
Testers indicated that the car needs improvements to its driving controls. 
The players said that they would like a test track but that when they were dropped into the game, they didn't know what was what. 
I should label the different events/places in the game. 
I also want to scale the game a bit better, trees were the wrong size and the terrain is bland.

# Design Hypothesis

I'm at the point now where I'm happy with the game and I just want to have more input on general gamefeel.
I have two questions: 

With a cleaner implementation, will the players finally be able to experience the gameplay I've designed for them?
Where will new issues arise and are they bugs or gameplay design opportunities?

# Playtesting results and final touch ups:

During my playtesting, I discovered that players were content with the feel of the car.
They found that the game was well constructed and all that was missing was "somethign to do"
This would probably be my signal to try and finalize the demo track.

I will add barriers to the next iteration, removing the need to add colliders ot the trees and keeping the focus of the game on racing. 
I will add sounds so the player understands how fast they are going. I will add a speedometer for additional help. 
Lastly, I will improve the lighting and settign of the game. I want the game to flow and feel relaxing. 

Here's the Itch IO page for the final Presentation on April 18th.
